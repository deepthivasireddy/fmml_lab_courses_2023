However, a common practice is to reserve around 20-30% of your data for validation when you have a moderate-sized dataset. This split strikes a balance between providing enough data for effective training and ensuring the validation set is large enough to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of how well your model generalizes to unseen data. It's essential to experiment and adjust this percentage based on your specific project's requirements and constraints"
